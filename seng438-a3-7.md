# 1 Introduction

In this assignment we did white box testing for the methods of org.jfree.data.Range.java and org.jfree.data.DataUtilities.java classes. We tested the code of all the methods in these two classes based on statemetn ocverage, brach coverage and condition coverage. We also did manual testing for DataUtilities.calculateColumnTotal(Values2D data, int column) and Range.intersects(double b0, double b1). For each of these methods, we covered the data flow graph, the def-use sets per statement, list all DU-pairs per variable, for each test case show which pairs are covered and  calculate the DU-Pair coverage.

# 3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test

The coverage tool used, EclEmma was very helpful since we could see what test cases we had to develop in order to over those statments, conditions, and branches. In general, the majority of the group went in order when determining which method they should cover. After throughly examining the method, what it does, and how the data is passed throughout the method, we started to think of values to use in our test cases that would cover the code. By trial and error, the test cases were slowly adjusted until most if not all of the method was covered. If there was a specific line or condition that could not be covered, the group discussed why we could not cover it, despite trying a variety of adjustments.

# 4 A high level description of five selected test cases you have designed using coverage information, and how they have increased code coverage

The original 5 methods we tested had 100% coverage or the parts missing could not be tested as those aspects of the code were inaccessible. However, using coverage information we were able to create more successful tests for other methods.

The coverage information supported us in creating the test case for the constrain method to check for numbers that are both above the upper bound and below the lower bound. Initially when creating the tests we did not account for both cases. However, once running the coverage test, we noticed that one of the if statements were not being tested and this lead us to creating the test case to check what happens when passing an argument which is less than the lower boundary. 

When working with the combineRange method, we originally created a test that passed two null ranges in order to test the if statements that check for the null ranges. Although we sent two null values in the argument, when testing coverage it appeared that the second if statement which checked for range2 being null would not be tested as range1 being null appeared first. A second test was then created with range1 having a valid object and range2 was null to allow the test to skip the first if statement and enter the second one and check the code.

# 6 Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report

For this assignment, everyone in the group used EclEmma and found it very useful in developing test coverages. It was the recommended tool, and it worked well since it was compatible with Eclipse, the preferred IDE used in this course. Becuase it worked well, learning how to develop test coverages was eassily understood. The only con that we found is that EclEmma does not include all the metrics mentioned in the assginemnt guideline.

# 7 A comparison on the advantages and disadvantages of requirements-based test generation and coverage-based test generation.

There are more advantages to coverage based testing than requirements testing. When using requirements based testing, we do not have information on how the method is implemented and some aspects of the code result in being not tested. With coverage based testing, we are able to go line by line and view every aspect of the code the tests are covering and what tests are missing. This allowed users to fully test every method and their functionalities. An advantage of requirements based testing is it allows programmers to test methods initially to check if the method functions in the desired manner, whereas with coverage the tests focus is on checking the aspects of the already created method.

# 8 A discussion on how the team work/effort was divided and managed

Initially, Carter started to set up the Eclipse project and attempted to use EclEmma since they had previous experience with test coverage. Farica, Michele, and Samira worked on interpreting the assignment guidelines to figure out what needed to be done and what needed to be submitted. From there, the group of three worked on the manual tasks that needed to be done for the assigned method and one simple method in Range.java. The entire group worked on creating test coverages for Range. Throughout the entire assignment, good communication was managed and support was given when needed from each member. 

# 9 Any difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned from performing the lab

We had a lot of difficulty to just run the code since the instructions given were not proper. We  had to do a lot of research and brainstorming on out part to just get this SUT running. There were no clear instructions on which libraries we had to import from Assignment 2 or assignment 1 or both. Even doing the manual part was not a cup of tea since the intructions were very vague.

# 10 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

The lab was extremely hard to interpret. Instructions were very unclear, and the entire group had a hard time finding what we had to do and what we had to submit. The calculations the lab asked for were also unclear and were not clearly discussed during class. This lead to further confusion and frustration. We asked for help from the TA, but the responses did not clear confusion.
