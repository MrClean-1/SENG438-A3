# 1 Introduction

In this assignment we did white box testing for the methods of org.jfree.data.Range.java and org.jfree.data.DataUtilities.java classes. We tested the code of all the methods in these two classes based on statemetn ocverage, brach coverage and condition coverage. We also did manual testing for DataUtilities.calculateColumnTotal(Values2D data, int column) and Range.intersects(double b0, double b1). For each of these methods, we covered the data flow graph, the def-use sets per statement, list all DU-pairs per variable, for each test case show which pairs are covered and  calculate the DU-Pair coverage.

### Data Flow Graph
### Def-Use sets per statement
DEF(123) = {data, column}, USE(123) = ∅

DEF(124) = ∅, USE(124) = {data}

DEF(125) = {total}, USE(125) = ∅

DEF(126) = {rowCount}, USE(126) = {data}

DEF(127) = {r}, USE(127) = {r, rowCount}

DEF(128) = {n}, USE(128) = {data, r, column}

DEF(129) = ∅, USE(129) = {n}

DEF(130) = {total}, USE(130) = {total, n}

DEF(133) = {r2}, USE(133) = {rowCount, r2}

DEF(134) = {n}, USE(134) = {r2, column, data}

DEF(135) = ∅, USE(135) = {n}

DEF(136) = {total}, USE(136) = {n, total}

DEF(139) = ∅, USE(139) = {total}


### DU pairs per Variable
data (1, 1)

column (1, 2) (1, 6)

r (2, 2) 

n (2, 4) (6, 8)

r2 (6, 6)

total (1, 4) (4, 4) (8, 8) (8, 10) (1,10) (1,8)


## Range.intersects
## Data Flow Graph
### Def-Use sets per statement
DEF(177) = ∅, USE(177) = {b0, b1}

DEF(179) = ∅, USE(179) = {b0, lower}

DEF(179) = ∅, USE(179) = {b1, lower}

DEF(183) = ∅, USE(183) = {b0, upper, b1}

### DU pairs per Variable
b0 (1, 2) (1, 4)

b1 (1, 3), (1, 4)

# 9 Any difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned from performing the lab

We had a lot of difficulty to just run the code since the instructions given were not proper. We  had to do a lot of research and brainstorming on out part to just get this SUT running. There were no clear instructions on which libraries we had to import from Assignment 2 or assignment 1 or both. Even doing the manual part was not a cup of tea since the intructions were very vague.

# 10 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

The lab was extremely hard to interpret. Instructions were very unclear, and the entire group had a hard time finding what we had to do and what we had to submit. The calculations the lab asked for were also unclear and were not clearly discussed during class. This lead to further confusion and frustration. We asked for help from the TA, but the responses did not clear confusion.
