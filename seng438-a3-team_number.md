# 1 Introduction

In this assignment we did white box testing for the methods of org.jfree.data.Range.java and org.jfree.data.DataUtilities.java classes. We tested the code of all the methods in these two classes based on statemetn ocverage, brach coverage and condition coverage. We also did manual testing for DataUtilities.calculateColumnTotal(Values2D data, int column) and Range.intersects(double b0, double b1). For each of these methids, we covered

# 4 A high level description of five selected test cases you have designed using coverage information, and how they have increased code coverage

Text…

# 5 A detailed report of the coverage achieved of each class and method (a screen shot from the code cover results in green and red color would suffice)
